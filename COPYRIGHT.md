# **lymph** copyright and license

This directory contains the **lymph** library.

The **lymph** library is copyrighted by the **lymph** authors.
This term refers to the people listed in the [`AUTHORS.md`](AUTHORS.md) file and in the
[list of contributors](https://gitlab.com/lifex/lifex/-/graphs/main)
to the repository, recorded by the version control system
[<kbd>git</kbd>](https://git-scm.com/) as commit authors.

**lymph** is free software; you can use it, redistribute it, and/or modify it under the terms of the

# Referencing **lymph**

In addition to the terms imposed by the AGPLv3 or later, we ask you for the following courtesy.

```
Every publication presenting numerical results obtained with the help
of lymph should state the name of the library, include a link to the
lymph webpage (https://lymph.bitbucket.io/) and cite appropriate
lymph references.
```

This is the usual, fair way of giving credit to contributors to a
scientific result. In addition, it helps us justify our effort in
developing **lymph** as an academic undertaking.
